<h4 >What is an eBook?</h4>
 <p class="icerikText">
    E-books are books that can be viewed and read on computers and other electronic devices, published digitally, containing text or pictures or both.      
    Although it is referred to as electronic versions of books published in dictionaries,
    the number of books that are only published in electronic environment and never published is increasing.
    In general, any file that can be read on Ipad, Android tablets, Smart phones, book reader devices and computers can be called E-books.
    <br> The biggest advantage of e-Books is that you can carry hundreds of books with you. You can carry around 10,000 - 15,000 books with you with a 32 GB memory,
    either in your phone or tablet without carrying an additional device, or with special eBook reader devices that are very easy to carry. 
    The closest e-book reading method to the real book experience is the e-book readers, which are produced for the purpose of reading
    e-books and do not contain a light source in the background and therefore do not tire the eyes more than a normal book.
    If you do not have an eBook reader, then you can also read books on your tablet or smart phone.</p>
